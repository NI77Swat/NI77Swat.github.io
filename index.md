Hi, i am a major for cpsc and i hope to finish by 2028

#Favorite CPSC Labs 120

*Lab 1

I liked lab 1 not because it was easy but, because it was a introductory towards how to use console commands and how we are using a text editor and submitting to github

*Lab 4 Part 2

For this part of the lab just trying to think about and make the secret number was fun. When i had errors and bugs i found it fun to try and solve them.

*Lab 12 Part 1

The last lab we had is truly one of my favorites and scariest because everything we were taught and learned was put into this lab and why its so scary because the code almost disappeared  

have a great day
